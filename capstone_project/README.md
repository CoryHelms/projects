Our project aims to create a website that will match college students' preferences in order to find compatible roommates studying at Indiana University Bloomington. Many students have had first-hand experience with bad roommates, or at least have had friends with roommate horror stories. Since college is a short period of time with great growth and development, there is no time to waste with awkward, strange, or even terrible encounters with roommates, due to incompatibility based on basic personality differences. Change is a stressful time for anyone, but our project attempts to smooth the transition, hopefully reducing the anxiety levels of students, and thus facilitating a better living situation and improved college experience. This system attempts to solve common problems and issues between roommates about general expectations, preferences, and needs, in order to pair people based on their commonalities drawn from our website's analysis. There are a variety of aspects and values that contribute to a healthy and content relationship, and by addressing those of each student, we can decrease the probability of unagreeable roommates by matching people with similar personalities. By acknowledging and utilizing people's expectations, preferences, and needs, we hope to increase the chance of an enjoyable experience during college by creating a positive living situation between compatible roommates.
